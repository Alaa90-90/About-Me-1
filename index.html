        <h1>About Me - YOUSEF OBEIDAT</h1>
    </header>

<p>
<h4>I am 24 years old and I recently graduated from JUST as an English language major. I spent my life living in Amman
    and I aim at gaining experience at this field as one of the first steps so I can continue to expand my horizon
    whether in Jordan or elsewhere.
    For a hobby, I spend my free time at the gym; specifically, resistance exercises which have helped me to free my
    mind of negativity, stress. This hobby has also led me into making decisions to find the path that was meant for me.
    As someone who is sociable, I believe I can employ my skills at this organization, also being a multi tasking person
    allows me to manage many tasks at the same time. My soft skills include the ability to communicate effectively, plan
    cooperatively, and strategize productively.
    Alongside the aforementioned, I recently took the IELTS test at British council, on the other hand, I am organized
    and highly attentive to detail which is why I believe I would be able to put those advantages to good use in the
    work field. My ability to work in a team has been improved during my years at university by working on several
    in-class group projects. Aside from that, I believe I have strong leadership capabilities, which I have proven,
    improved, and expanded on throughout presentations and assignments.
    As a motivated achiever, I am always looking forward to learn something new, which is why I have chosen to apply to
    this work field ; to take me on a trip of self-development personally and professionally.
